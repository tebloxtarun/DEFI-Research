Why the Need for solidly?

*   TVL is often used to judge a DeFi protocol but can be misleading.
*   Example: UniswapV3 generated $4.51M in fees over 7 days; top 30 pairs did $3.56M (79.03%) of those fees.
*   These pairs account for $1.11B (31.31%) of total TVL.
*   Remaining $2.44B (68.68%) of TVL is less efficient.

How is Solidly Different?

*   Self-optimizing decentralized exchange for capital-efficient TVL acquisition.
*   Distributes 100% of fees to governance tokens, unlike Uniswap (0%) or Curve (50%).
*   Combines Uniswap's AMM design and Curve's stable-pool innovations with a ve(3,3) rewards system.
*   Maximizes yield for stakeholders and provides predictable income for liquidity providers.

Emission Allocation

*   Liquidity providers earn SOLID tokens (ERC-20).
*   Tokens can be sold or locked into veSOLID NFT positions (ERC-721) with locks from 1 week to 4 years.
*   Longer locks provide higher voting power, revenue share, and dilution protection.
*   veSOLID tokens used to vote for specific pairs, determining SOLID emissions allocation.
*   Voting takes place weekly; voters earn fees from pools they vote on, paid in base assets of the pair.

Incentives and Anti-Dilution

*   63% of total supply distributed through liquidity mining incentives.
*   25% allocated to strategic partner protocols.
*   Possible 2% team allocation in 4-year locked veSOLID for long-term operations.
*   Anti-dilution mechanism protects users from future inflation with 100% anti-dilutive rebases for 4-year locks.

Pool Types and Fees

*   Combines volatile and stable pools.
*   Default fees: 0.2% for volatile pools, 0.02% for stable pools.
*   Fees adjustable based on market conditions; individual pools adjustable by governance.
*   Focus on capital-efficient pools for correlated assets and leveraged trading.

Solidly History

*   Originally developed by Andre Cronje, later refactored by a new team.
*   Migration achieved 92.91% success rate.
*   Aim to fix and improve Solidly v1 code-base, support affected users, and realign partner protocol incentives.

Governance

*    Initially guided by the team for smooth launch and growth.
*    Plan to make Solidly more immutable, permissionless, and censorship-resistant over time.
