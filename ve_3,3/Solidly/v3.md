## V3 Swaps

Solidly V3 introduced a concentrated liquidity AMM, forked from Uniswap V3, with significant differences and gas savings of up to 50%.

#### Key Features

- **Concentrated Liquidity AMM (CLAMM)**: Allows liquidity providers to choose specific price ranges for providing liquidity.
- **Capital Efficiency**: Concentrating liquidity in specific ranges makes more capital available to traders, reducing slippage.

#### Comparison to V2
- Similar to V2 constant product AMM but with enhanced liquidity concentration capabilities.
- Enables liquidity provision across the 0 to infinity curve with targeted price ranges.

*Concentrated liquidity takes on a similar shape of liquidity which can be found on more efficient forms of trading venues like centralized exchanges, or stock and forex markets.*


## Features

Solidly V3 has a concentrated liquidity AMM (CLAMM), forked from Uniswap V3 but with some distinct differences:

*    Up to 50% gas savings on swaps and up to 60% gas savings on mints/burns

*    Full JIT liquidity protection - a form of MEV attack on liquidity providers
    [JIT Protection](#JIT_Protection)

*    IL-Protection through dynamic fees, triggered during extreme volatility events
    [IL Protection](#IL_Protection)

*    A redesigned way to incentivize and deepen liquidity
    [Rewards Distributor](#Rewards_Distributor)


## Gas_Savings

One of the main pitfalls for Solidly V2 (Legacy) was the substantial gas cost associated with transactions. For Solidly V3 we have gone into the complete opposite direction, producing the world's most gas efficient CLAMM DEX. Solidly V3 prides itself on offering up to 50% gas savings for traders and as much as 60% for liquidity providers in comparison to Uniswap V3.

We'll let the numbers speak for themselves. Our approach was quite straightforward, we either removed or significantly scaled back the following elements from the original Uniswap V3 implementation:

*    Oracles

*    External Callbacks

*    Fee Accounting => [RewardsDistributor.sol](#Rewards_Distributor)

## JIT_Protection

### What is JIT Liquidity and Why is it Harmful?

**JIT Liquidity Explained**

* Just-In-Time (JIT) Liquidity: Injecting a large amount of liquidity into a specific price range during a transaction block to get better price execution. This allows the JIT bot to capture most of the trading fees, disadvantaging other liquidity providers.
* Parasitic Practice: JIT liquidity exploits the presence of consistent liquidity providers who assume capital risk and facilitate market conditions. The JIT strategy benefits from their groundwork without contributing to the long-term stability of the market.

**Example**

* Etherscan Example: A JIT provider injected $20M into a narrow price range for a swap, increasing liquidity by 40 times and capturing 97.5% of the trading fees.
* Impact: The JIT provider earned $58.44 from $60 in fees, while other liquidity providers shared just $1.56 from $65M in total liquidity. This highlights the inefficiency and unfairness in Uniswap V3â€™s liquidity provision, which Solidly V3 aims to address.


**How does Solidly V3 Solve the JIT Problem?**

Liquidity providers on Solidly start earning immediately after minting but they have a 10 minute "ramp-up" time. When a swap happens the fee is distributed pro-rata among all liquiditySeconds of the past 10 minutes. A position that is minted and burned in the same block accrues zero liquiditySeconds meaning that 1-block JITs would donate their fees to the providers of the previous 10 minutes. A multi-block JIT would also earn nothing, because at the point of minting the position into the fee block, it will also be at zero liquiditySeconds, the first block where they earn fees would be the subsequent block, and they would get massively diluted by the aggregate liquiditySeconds of all loyal LPs of the past 10 minutes. Even if the subsequent block had a swap in it, JIT liquidity would get massively diluted in our model, but  most importantly there's no guarantee that the subsequent block would have any fees, so JIT liquidity provision would become inherently speculative and thus infeasible.

**How Does this Affect LP Yields?**

All the fees that would go to would-be JITs go directly to liquidity providers on Solidly. The APR you typically see on yield information pages is not accurate for Uniswap V3, as they do not discount the amount of fees earned by JIT liquidity. As in the example above, the APR would be reduced by 97.5%, but of course not every swap get sandwiched by a JIT bot. Solidly Labs is working on a dashboard that accurately reflects real yield rates between liquidity providers on Solidly V3 vs. Uniswap V3.


## IL_Protection

#### Problem: Impermanent Loss
- Many retail liquidity providers (LPs) lose money due to:
  - **JIT Liquidity**
  - **Toxic Flow**

These issues benefit advanced actors like MEVs, VCs, and hedge funds.

#### Solution: Dynamic Fees
- **Goal**: Make liquidity providing profitable and simple.
- **Implementation**: Dynamic fees protect pools from toxic flow during volatile market moves.
  - During market volatility, arbitrageurs balance prices, often profiting at LPs' expense.
  - Instead of external trading, Solidly's pools adjust fees dynamically to retain profits for LPs.

#### JIT Fees
- **Turning the Tables**: Transform AMM into a JIT fee extractor.
- **Algorithm**: Senses incoming volatility and adjusts pool fees accordingly.
  - **High Fees**: During high volatility (high risk of toxic flow).
  - **Low Fees**: During low volatility (low risk of toxic flow).
- **Outcome**: Arbitrageurs still trade but leave most profits with LPs, maximizing their returns while providing minimal bounties to arbitrageurs.

This approach ensures that liquidity providers are better protected and can claim a fairer share of the profits generated through their contributions.

## Rewards_Distributor

#### An Efficient Piece of Machinery
Solidly V3 introduces a better way to distribute rewards. Previously, bribes, fees, and emissions were handled by separate contracts, resulting in static distribution designs and high transaction costs.

#### Basic Functionalities
The new contract, RewardsDistributor.sol ("RD"), handles:
- Fetching fees from pools
- Storing and tabulating:
  - LP Bribes
  - Voter Bribes
  - Weekly Emissions
  - Trading fees
- Storing merkle roots
- Verifying user claims

#### Off-chain Processor
Solidly Labs created a solution to track and simulate the on-chain flow of Solidly V3 pools:
- Fetches user actions (swaps, mints, burns, votes, bribes)
- Simulates on-chain states
- Creates merkle trees and proofs
- Pushes the merkle root on-chain onto the RD

#### How Does it Work?
The off-chain processor and RD produce merkle trees, which represent all on-chain reward earnings. A root is generated and pushed on-chain, serving as the source of truth. Users submit merkle proofs to the RD, which verifies and distributes rewards cost-effectively.

- Merkle roots are pushed on-chain every 24 hours.
- Following a one-hour security buffer, rewards become eligible for claiming.
- Liquidity providers retain full custody of their capital, earning rewards "over the air."

#### Advanced Use-cases
- Customized incentivization ranges for CL
- Detection and filtering of malicious JIT liquidity
- Significant gas savings

#### Security Considerations and Decentralization
- Security time buffer after each merkle push, allowing third-parties to stop the RD with a collateral deposit
- Multi-signatures and time-locks
- Multi-verification setup
- Steadfast decentralization efforts

Solidly is exploring running the off-chain processor on EigenLayer or rolling it into an Ethereum L2 solution. All data used to calculate rewards is published for transparency and verification.
