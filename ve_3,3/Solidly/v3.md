## Features

Solidly V3 has a concentrated liquidity AMM (CLAMM), forked from Uniswap V3 but with some distinct differences:

*    Up to 50% gas savings on swaps and up to 60% gas savings on mints/burns

*    Full JIT liquidity protection - a form of MEV attack on liquidity providers
    (JIT Protection)[https://docs.solidly.com/v3/jit-protection]

*    IL-Protection through dynamic fees, triggered during extreme volatility events
    (IL Protection)[https://docs.solidly.com/v3/il-protection]

## Gas_Savings

One of the main pitfalls for Solidly V2 (Legacy) was the substantial gas cost associated with transactions. For Solidly V3 we have gone into the complete opposite direction, producing the world's most gas efficient CLAMM DEX. Solidly V3 prides itself on offering up to 50% gas savings for traders and as much as 60% for liquidity providers in comparison to Uniswap V3.

We'll let the numbers speak for themselves. Our approach was quite straightforward, we either removed or significantly scaled back the following elements from the original Uniswap V3 implementation:

*    Oracles

*    External Callbacks

*    Fee Accounting => (RewardsDistributor.sol)[##]
