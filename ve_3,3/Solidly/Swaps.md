## V3 Swaps

Solidly V3 has a concentrated liquidity AMM, forked from Uniswap V3 but with some distinct differences and enormous gas savings of up to 50%, which are further explained in Solidly V3

Like in the V2 constant product AMM, the concentrated liquidity AMM ("CLAMM") goes from 0 to infinity. However, unlike in V2, liquidity providers can choose to provide liquidity in specific price ranges across the 0 to infinity curve. Concentrating liquidity in specific ranges leads to more capital being available to traders with less slippage.
