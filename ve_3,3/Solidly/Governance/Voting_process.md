### Process Flow of Voting

1. Lock SOLID (ERC-20) into a veSOLID NFT (ERC-721) for 1 week - 4 years.
2. Vote for specific liquidity pools (e.g., USDC-WETH).
3. Collect voter bribes and fees only from pools you voted on.

### Reward Flow of Voting

There are 2 types of rewards that voters benefit from:

1. **Voter Bribes**:
   - Deposited before the epoch starts.
   - Claimable on a pro-rata basis immediately after the epoch flips (Thursdays 00:00:00 UTC).

2. **Trading Fees**:
   - Generated during the epoch.
   - Become claimable as they stream in.
   - Recommended to claim after accumulating enough to make gas costs negligible.
