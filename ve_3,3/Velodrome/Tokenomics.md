## Tokenomics

Velodrome Finance uses two tokens to manage its utility and governance:

    $VELO — ERC-20 utility token of the protocol
    $veVELO — ERC-721 governance token in the form of an NFT (non-fungible token)

$VELO is distributed to liquidity providers through emissions.

$veVELO is used for governance. Any $VELO holder can vote-escrow their tokens and receive a $veVELO (also known as Lock or veNFT) in exchange. Additional tokens can be added to the $veVELO NFT at any time.

The lock period (also known as vote-escrowed period, hence the ve prefix) can be up to 4 years, following the linear relationship shown below:

    100 $VELO locked for 4 years will become 100 $veVELO
    100 $VELO locked for 1 year will become 25 $veVELO

The longer the vesting time, the higher the voting power (voting weight).

Additionally, with Velodrome v2 the Lock (veNFT) can be set into a permanent maximum lock time. These permalocked Locks (veNFTs) are always treated by the protocol as being locked for the maximum duration of 4 years, and their voting power does not decay.
Initial Distribution

The initial distribution of $VELO and $veVELO was done for users and protocols likeliest to contribute to protocol mission to become the liquidity base layer of the Optimism ecosystem.

## Community

240M (60%) $VELO tokens were distributed to the people who have played the biggest role in incubating Velodrome and those likeliest to contribute to its long-term success, including:

*   $WEVE holders (27%, 108M $VELO)
*   $OP network users (18%, 72M $VELO)
*   3755 $VELO/wallet — Addresses qualified as Repeat Optimism Users

*   Cross-chain DeFi users (15%, 60M $VELO):
*   3500 $VELO/wallet — Curve Protocol wallets with a 1450+ days (maximum) $veCRV lock time
*   3000 $VELO/wallet — Convex Protocol lockers of $vlCVX since new lock contract deployment
*   3000 $VELO/wallet — Treasure DAO Genesis Mine $MAGIC stakers for 1- and 3-month periods
*   2000 $VELO/wallet — Platypus Protocol stakers with $vePTP and $PTP balance
*   500 $VELO/wallet — Redacted Cartel participants in genesis Dutch auction who didn't sell their $BTRFLY
*   500 $VELO/wallet — Eminence Finance wallets affected with EMN, eAAVE, eLINK, eYFI, eSNX or eCRV balance

## Protocols

The airdrop of 72M (18%) $veVELO is aimed at attracting and engaging 10-15 protocols most likely to contribute to Velodrome and Optimism's long-term success.

## Grants

24M (6%) $veVELO were reserved to distribute to partner protocols after the launch. This was used to engage partners in the ecosystem through grants.

## Foundation

* The Foundation received an initial allocation that was used to vote to drive emissions to key protocol pairs such as $VELO-$USDC and support ongoing protocol development. The total Foundation allocation was 40M (10%) in $VELO and $veVELO.
* The Foundation vested 100% of its initial allocation in the form of $veVELO and uses it to vote via the Velodrome Protocol in perpetuity.
* To help cover ongoing expenses and all the upcoming development efforts, 3% of the emissions are going to the Foundation address. These emissions are used to lock and increase the Foudnation's '$veVELO' holdings, distribute as incentives via the protocol, or engage in various efforts to further the distribution and adoption of the protocol.

### Team compensation breakdown:

* 15,520,816 $VELO was set aside for contributor compensation. 0.5% of total emissions, taken from emissions to the Foundation described above, will be added to this total for dilution control during the 12-month compensation period. All team compensation has been distributed as of June 2023 with 15,345,334.2 VELO bought back from team members and the remainder distributed as '$VELO'.

## Optimism
Optimism has a vested interest in ensuring that Velodrome achieves its mission of serving as an ecosystem public good. Optimism received 20M (5%) $veVELO in the initial distribution, to support that interest.

## Genesis Liquidity Pools
Genesis Pools distributed 4M (1%) $VELO to liquidity providers of foundational token pairs to provide better liquidity and user experience from launch day. Genesis pool emissions were first directed to the $VELO-$USDC pool and started a few days before the first epoch votes were cast.
