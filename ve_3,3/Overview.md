# Introduction

The ve(3,3) model is a sophisticated tokenomics design that enhances long-term participation and aligns protocol incentives with fee generation. The model addresses issues in traditional liquidity mining by tying token emissions to fee generation and locking mechanisms. It uses dynamic emissions and NFT tokenization to create a sustainable and efficient DeFi ecosystem.


## Key Mechanism
### Token Locking and veTokens

*    ve`Tokens`: Users lock base tokens (e.g., `$VELO`) to receive veTokens (e.g., `$veVELO`), which grant voting power and access to rewards.
*    Lock Period: Ranges from 1 week to 4 years. Longer locks provide more voting power and rewards.
*    Decay: veTokens decay over time, reducing voting power and rewards as the lock period progresses.

### Emissions

*    Dynamic Emission Adjustment: Weekly token emissions adjust based on the percentage of circulating supply locked. If 50% of tokens are locked, emissions are halved.
*    Proportional Increase: veToken holders' balances increase proportionally with emissions to prevent dilution.

### NFT Integration

*    Tokenization: Lock positions are represented as NFTs, allowing trading and borrowing against locked tokens, adding liquidity.
*    Multiple Locks: Users can own multiple veNFTs, managing different lock periods and amounts.

### Fee Distribution

*    Protocol Fees: veToken holders earn fees generated by the protocol. Fees are typically distributed in the assets accrued, not the native token, to avoid correlation and volatility issues.

## Practical Applications
### Solidlyâ€™s Implementation

*    New AMM Design: Supports swaps between both correlated and uncorrelated assets, and integrates Uniswap v2 compatible interfaces.
*    Fee Incentives: Emphasizes trading fee generation over liquidity incentives. veSOLID holders earn fees and can receive bribes to vote for specific pools.
*    Initial Distribution: Tokens distributed based on voting weights, with an initial airdrop to top projects by TVL.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

#### Advantages:

*    Incentivizes Long-Term Participation: Encourages users to lock tokens, aligning interests with protocol longevity.
*    Sustainable Emissions: Adjustments ensure emissions do not lead to unsustainable inflation.
*    Capital Efficiency: NFT integration provides liquidity and secondary market trading options for locked tokens.

#### Disadvantages:

*    Complexity: Requires understanding of advanced tokenomics and game theory.
*    Liquidity Lockup: Locked tokens reduce immediate liquidity.
*    Potential Centralization: Large holders can exert significant influence over emissions and governance.
