### Detailed Components of the `Simple Storage` Smart Contract

| Component                       | Description                                                                                                                               | Solidity Example                        | Detailed Remarks                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Contract Licensing**          | Specifies the license under which the smart contract is published.                                                                        | `// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0`   | Indicates the source code is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0, important for open-source sharing. |
| **Pragma Directive**            | Instructs the compiler on the specific versions of Solidity that are appropriate for compiling the contract.                               | `pragma solidity >=0.4.16 <0.9.0;`      | Ensures the contract is not compiled with a new (breaking) compiler version where it could behave differently.    |
| **Contract Definition**         | Defines a new contract, which is a collection of code (functions) and data (state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. | `contract SimpleStorage {...}`          | Outlines the structure of a contract in Solidity, which is akin to a class in object-oriented programming.        |
| **State Variable `storedData`** | Declares a state variable of 256 bits within the contract to store data persistently on the blockchain.                                                 | `uint storedData;`                     | `storedData` is an unsigned integer that acts like a single slot in a database that can be queried and altered.  |
| **Set Function**                | A function that allows external modification of the `storedData`.                                                                          | `function set(uint x) public {...}`     | Public function that sets the `storedData` variable to the value passed to it, x.                               |
| **Get Function**                | A function for retrieving the value of `storedData`. It is marked with the `view` modifier, indicating it does not alter the state.         | `function get() public view returns (uint) {...}` | Public view function that returns the current value of `storedData`, indicating it only reads data.            |
| **Access and Overwriting**      | The contract allows any external caller to set or overwrite the stored number, but all interactions remain recorded in the blockchain's history. | N/A                                     | Emphasizes the openness of blockchain data, where access is global but changes are permanent and traceable.       |
| **Unicode and ASCII Note**      | Notes the use of ASCII for identifiers in the contract, and the capability to store UTF-8 encoded data in string variables.                | N/A                                     | Highlights care with Unicode text due to potential differences in similar-looking characters.                     |

To access a member (like a state variable) of the current contract, you do not typically add the this. prefix, you just
access it directly via its name.  it is not just a matter of style, it results in a completely different way to access the member

| **Element** | **Content** | **Details** | **Implications** |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Note**    | Identifiers must use ASCII; UTF-8 can be used in string variables. | All contract, function, and variable names should be composed of ASCII characters only to ensure compatibility with the Solidity compiler. UTF-8 encoded data is permissible in string variables for storing a wide range of characters, supporting internationalization. | **Identifiers**: Ensures that the Solidity code is compatible and avoids parsing errors. <br> **Data Storage**: Allows for the storage of global character sets, accommodating international content and enhancing application versatility. |
| **Warning** | Caution advised with Unicode text due to potential for identical characters to have different code points. | Similar-looking or identical characters in Unicode might have different underlying code points, leading to different byte array encodings. This can affect how data is stored, displayed, and processed. | **Security and Data Integrity**: Raises awareness about potential security vulnerabilities (like homoglyph attacks) and the importance of accurate character handling in smart contracts. Ensures that developers are aware of the nuances in Unicode to prevent data mishandling and security flaws. |
