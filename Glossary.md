## General Terms

* Trading Fee
> A fee charged by a decentralized exchange (DEX) or an automated market maker (AMM) for facilitating trades between assets. This fee is usually a small percentage of the trade value and is distributed to liquidity providers or governance token holders.

* Emissions
> Release of new tokens into circulation by a protocol, often used as rewards for participants who provide liquidity or other servies to support the network/ecosystem. They can be controlled to manage inflation and incentivize desired behaviours.

* Bribes
> Incentives offered to ve`Token` holders to vote in favor of specific pools or proposals. Bribes can be in the form of additional tokens or rewards, encouraging strategic voting that aligns with the interests of the bribing party.

* Liquidity Mining
> A process where users provide liquidity to a DeFi protocol (such as a DEX) in exchange for rewards. These rewards typically come in the form of newly minted tokens or protocol fees, incentivizing users to supply liquidity and increase the platform's overall liquidity.

* Protocol Fees
> Mechanisms used by a protocol to encourage participation and align the interests of its users. Fees collected from transactions or other activities are often redistributed as incentives to users who contribute to the protocol's success, such as liquidity providers or stakers.

* Concentrated Liquidity
> A concept in DeFi that allows LPs to allocate their capital within a specific price range rather than across the entire price spectrum. This means LPs can concentrate their liquidity where they expect the most trading activity to occur, increasing the efficiency of their capital.

* Impermanent Loss
> Imagine you deposit 1 ETH (worth $2,000) and 2,000 USDC into a 50/50 ETH/USDC liquidity pool. The total value of your deposit is $4,000.
>
> 1.  Price Change: The price of ETH increases from $2,000 to $3,000.
> 2.  Pool Rebalancing: To maintain the 50/50 balance, the pool adjusts the asset ratios. You might end up with 0.577 ETH and 2,823 USDC.
> 3.  Value Comparison: If you withdraw your assets, you get $1,731 in ETH and $2,823 in USDC, totaling $4,554.
> 4.  Holding Comparison: If you had just held 1 ETH and 2,000 USDC, their total value would be $5,000.
> 5.  Impermanent Loss: The difference, $446, is your impermanent loss, showing you would have been better off holding the assets rather than providing liquidity.
