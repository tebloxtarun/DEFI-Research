### 1. **Detailed Use Case Description**
   - **Use Case Name:** Swap Tokens
   - **Actor:** Trader/User
   - **Description:** This use case describes the process by which a Trader/User exchanges one type of cryptocurrency for another on a DEX platform.
   - **Preconditions:** The Trader/User must have a connected wallet with sufficient balance of the token they wish to swap.
   - **Postconditions:** The swap is completed, and the Trader/User's wallet reflects the new balances of the involved cryptocurrencies.
   - **Main Success Scenario:**
     1. The Trader/User selects the "Swap Tokens" option on the DEX interface.
     2. The DEX displays fields to input the types and amounts of tokens to be swapped.
     3. The Trader/User enters the details of the tokens they wish to swap and the desired tokens in return.
     4. The DEX calculates and displays the exchange rate, including any fees.
     5. The Trader/User confirms the details and proceeds with the swap.
     6. The DEX executes the transaction on the blockchain.
     7. The DEX confirms the transaction success and updates the user interface to show the updated balances.
   - **Extensions:**
     - **4a.** Insufficient balance:
       - **4a1.** The DEX notifies the Trader/User of insufficient funds and prevents the transaction from proceeding.
     - **5a.** The Trader/User rejects the exchange rate or fees:
       - **5a1.** The Trader/User cancels the transaction.
     - **6a.** Transaction fails due to blockchain or network issues:
       - **6a1.** The DEX notifies the Trader/User of the failure and suggests retrying later.
   - **Special Requirements:** Secure transaction handling to prevent fraud and ensure accurate exchange rates are applied.

### 2. **Requirement Specification**
   - **Functional Requirements:**
     - The system must accurately calculate and display exchange rates and fees.
     - The system must verify wallet balances before processing swaps.
     - The system should handle transaction failures and network errors gracefully.
   - **Non-Functional Requirements:**
     - Security: Implement secure transaction protocols and ensure user data protection.
     - Reliability: Ensure high availability of the DEX services, especially during high network traffic.
     - Usability: Provide an intuitive interface for conducting swaps with clear instructions and feedback.

### 3. **System Design**
   - **Architecture:** Design the system to integrate with a smart contract that handles the swap logic on the blockchain.
   - **Database Design:** Maintain a transaction log for audit and recovery purposes.
   - **Security Design:** Use encryption for transaction data and secure API calls between the user interface and the blockchain.

### 4. **Prototyping**
   - Develop interactive prototypes for the swap interface, focusing on user input, confirmation dialogs, and transaction status updates.

### 5. **Development**
   - Implement the swap feature using smart contracts for decentralized execution.
   - Ensure integration with the front end and the blockchain network is robust and secure.

### 6. **Testing**
   - **Unit Testing:** Test smart contract functions and user interface components separately.
   - **Integration Testing:** Ensure the entire swap process works seamlessly from the user interface through to the blockchain.
   - **System Testing:** Simulate various scenarios including successful swaps, insufficient balances, and network failures.
   - **Acceptance Testing:** Have actual users test the swap functionality in a controlled environment to validate the entire process.

### 7. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the swap functionality in stages, monitoring for any issues and gathering user feedback for immediate adjustments.

### 8. **Training and Documentation**
   - Provide comprehensive guides on how to perform token swaps, including troubleshooting common issues.

### 9. **Maintenance and Iteration**
   - Regularly update the swap mechanism based on user feedback and changes in blockchain technology.
   - Monitor and optimize the system for performance and security.
