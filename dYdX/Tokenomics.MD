**The DYDX token is the L1 protocol token for the dYdX Chain, as agreed by the dYdX community through dYdX governance**

DYDX is distributed to users by validators on the dYdX Chain on a 1-1 proportional basis based on the amount of Ethereum-based DYDX (ethDYDX) that each user sends to the wethDYDX Smart Contract.

The allocation of DYDX is based on the allocation of ethDYDX. The allocation of ethDYDX changed since its launch on August 3, 2021 due to several governance proposals. The updated allocation of ethDYDX:

Migration to the dYdX Chain
The wethDYDX Smart Contract enables the migration of ethDYDX from Ethereum to the dYdX Chain.

When interacted with, the wethDYDX Smart Contract would carry out the following functions in a fully permissionless and automated manner: Receive and permanently lock the ethDYDX tokens sent by the user to the wethDYDX Smart Contract; Send a wrapped version of the Ethereum-based DYDX token (“wethDYDX”) to the user on a 1-1 proportional basis on Ethereum; and dYdX Chain Validators can also read and ingest the information in the wethDYDX Smart Contract such that corresponding DYDX can be distributed to users by Validators on the dYdX Chain once there is confirmation that Step 1 above is complete and the ethDYDX is permanently locked in the wethDYDX Smart Contract.
