|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **BalanceLogicLibrary**        | - Provides utility functions for managing and querying voting power and historical data for the Voting Escrow contract. <br> - Implements binary search algorithms to fetch user and global point indices at or prior to a given timestamp. <br> - Calculates the voting power for a given NFT at a specific epoch time. <br> - Computes total voting power at a specific past time, accounting for slope changes and permanent locks. <br> - Utilizes SafeCastLibrary for safe type conversions between uint256 and int128.|  
| **DelegationHelperLibrary**        | - Provides utility functions to assist with delegation logic in the Velodrome V2 ecosystem. <br> - Implements a binary search algorithm to fetch the checkpoint index for a given timestamp. <br> - Calculates the locked balance owed to a locked NFT at a specific timepoint, including rewards projected for the following epoch. <br> - Utilizes the VelodromeTimeLibrary for time-based operations and the SafeCastLibrary for safe type conversions. <br> - Incorporates Math library for mathematical operations and ensuring safe calculations. <br> - Integrates with the IVotingEscrow and IReward interfaces to fetch necessary data for reward calculations.|  
| **DelegationLogicLibrary**        | - Manages the logic for updating delegator voting checkpoints when minting, transferring, burning, or delegating tokens. <br> - Automatically handles dedelegation and updates checkpoints accordingly. <br> - Implements a binary search to retrieve historical voting balance for a token ID at a given timestamp. <br> - Utilizes SafeCastLibrary for safe type conversions and ensures proper delegation and dedelegation logic. <br> - Provides functionality to fetch the voting checkpoint index and calculate the voting power, including delegation adjustments.|  
| **SafeCastLibrary**        | - Provides utility functions for safely converting between unsigned and signed integers without overflow or underflow. <br> - Implements toInt128 to safely convert a uint256 to an int128. <br> - Implements toUint256 to safely convert an int128 to a uint256. <br> - Reverts with specific errors (SafeCastOverflow and SafeCastUnderflow) if the conversions are not possible.|  
| **VelodromeTimeLibrary**        | - Provides utility functions to manage time-based operations within the Velodrome V2 ecosystem. <br> - Defines a constant WEEK representing the duration of a week in seconds. <br> - Implements epochStart to calculate the start of the epoch based on the current timestamp. <br> - Implements epochNext to calculate the start of the next epoch. <br> - Implements epochVoteStart to calculate the start of the voting window. <br> - Implements epochVoteEnd to calculate the end of the voting window and the beginning of the unrestricted voting window.|

| **Pool**        | - Implements a token pool for Velodrome V2, supporting both stable and volatile pools. <br> - Handles token swapping, minting, burning, fee collection, and liquidity management. <br> - Calculates output amounts for token swaps, manages reserves, and updates price accumulators. <br> - Integrates with IPoolCallee for callback functions, enabling flash loan functionality. <br> - Utilizes OpenZeppelin libraries for security and mathematical operations.|  
| **PoolFees**        | - Manages fee collection and distribution for the Pool contract. <br> - Allows the pool to transfer accumulated fees to users. <br> - Ensures fee handling is segregated from core liquidity operations, enhancing security. |
| **Router**             | - Supports complex operations like multi-pool swaps and LP deposits/withdrawals.<br>- Enables zapping in/out of pools from any ERC20 token.<br>- Handles transactions involving fee-on-transfer tokens. |
| **RewardsDistributor** | - Calculates and distributes rebases based on the VELO locked and unlocked just before each epoch transition.<br>- Handles claims of rewards by NFT owners, distributing based on contribution to locked VELO. |
| **VeArtProxy** | - Generates dynamic SVG artwork for veNFTs based on token-specific attributes. <br> - Uses pseudorandom seed generation for creating unique line art shapes. <br> - Supports various geometric shapes and line art styles, enhancing visual uniqueness. <br> - Encodes metadata and artwork in Base64 format for compatibility with NFT standards. <br> - Interfaces with the Voting Escrow contract to fetch token attributes and balances. |
| **Velo** | - Defines the native token for the Velodrome V2 ecosystem, named VELO. <br> - Inherits from ERC20 and ERC20Permit to provide standard token functionalities and permit-based approvals. <br> - Manages the minting of tokens, restricted to the designated minter. <br> - Allows setting a new minter through the setMinter function, restricted to the current minter. |
