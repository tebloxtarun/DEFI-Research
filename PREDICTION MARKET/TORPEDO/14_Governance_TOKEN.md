| Create Prediction Markets | Market creators must hold 1000 Torp to **create new markets on Torpedo**.                                                                                                      |
|                           | Creators don’t need to spend Torp to create markets, they simply need to hold Torp.                                                                                                |
|                           | This requirement ensures that prediction market creators have “skin in the game” and reduces the likelihood of human- or bot-originated spam.                                      |
| Resolve Prediction Markets| Torp is used in the **decentralized bonding system used by Torpedo to resolve markets**.                                                                                      |
|                           | Oracles must bond TORP to the outcome they believe is correct.                                                                                                                     |
|                           | This crowd-sourced resolution process ensures that no single entity controls the markets.                                                                                          |
| Curate Prediction Markets | Torp is required for users to **upvote or downvote markets**, providing a signal on the quality of prediction markets to other users and dapps.                                    |
|                           | Curators are only required to hold Torp to vote on markets, they don’t need to spend their Torp.                                                                                   |
|                           | This requirement reduces the likelihood of vote-bombing.                                                                                                                           |
