| **Question**              | The question defines what the prediction market is about by asking what the outcome of an event will be. It should be written in a clear and unambiguous manner, so that forecasters are always sure what the predictions they’re asked to make are related to.                                                                                                                  | "Which candidate will win the 2022 Brazilian general election?"                         |
| **Outcomes**              | A Prediction Market must have at least two possible outcomes, and can have up to 32 possible outcomes. Outcomes must be written in a clear and unambiguous manner, and cover all the possibilities of how the future event may unfold. Outcomes are always priced between 0 and 1 units of the market’s selected token, and the sum of the prices of all outcomes in a market is always equal to 1. | Lula priced at 0.7, Bolsonaro priced at 0.29, and “Someone else” priced at 0.01.        |
| **Closing date**          | A Prediction Market must always close at a certain date, set by the Market Creator before the market is Open – the Closing Date. The Closing Date should be set to before the event happens, so that trading stops before the outcome is known and that outcome prices don’t become heavily skewed.                                                                                 | October 1, 2022                                                                         |
| **Description**           | It is paramount that forecasters understand the criteria used to determine the right outcome of a Prediction Market. The Description field must be used to clarify the context of the market, and the criteria for determining the correct outcome, and in what circumstances the market must be considered Invalid.                                                              | The correct outcome will be determined according to the election result published by the Superior Electoral Court of Brazil. The market must be considered Invalid if the election is canceled or postponed.   |
| **Resolution source**     | A Polkamarkets Prediction Market must include the URL of a trustworthy source where the correct and indisputable outcome of the market will be published.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [Superior Electoral Court of Brazil](https://www.tse.jus.br/)                           |
| **Category and Subcategory** | The Category and Subcategory fields are intended for the developers of web applications and data visualization tools to make it easier for end-users to find markets that are of interest to them.                                                                                                                                                                              | Category: Politics<br>Subcategory: Brazil or Elections                                 |
| **Image**                 | The Image field takes in the URL of a JPG, GIF, or PNG file that can be used to illustrate a market when the information is displayed on a web page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | An image of the flag of Brazil                                                          |
| **Blockchain / Network**  | The Polkamarkets Protocol is deployed on several blockchains/networks, but a given market can only exist in one blockchain/network. Similar markets can be created on other networks where the protocol is deployed as well, but they will operate independently.                                                                                                              | Polygon                                                                                 |
| **Token**                 | Polkamarkets Prediction Markets can operate with any ERC-20 token chosen by the Market Creator that exists on any blockchain where the protocol is deployed. The token’s contract address must be supplied when creating a market to specify which token that market will operate with.                                                                                            | $USDC, contract address on Polygon: 0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174          |
| **Liquidity**             | A Polkamarkets Prediction Market must have an appropriate amount of liquidity to enable meaningful trades. The protocol uses an Automated Market Maker (AMM) algorithm to make it possible for anyone to add and remove liquidity to markets at any moment. Market Creators are required to add liquidity when they create a market.                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Liquidity Providers Fee** | To incentivize liquid markets, the Polkamarkets Protocol gives Market Creators the possibility to set a trading fee as a reward for Liquidity Providers. By default, it is set to be 2% of every trade, but the Market Creator can set a higher fee (up to 5%), a lower fee, or even remove the fee by setting it to 0%. Adding liquidity to a market can be rewarding, but it is not without risks. | 2% (default, but can be adjusted by the Market Creator)                                 |
| **Creator Fee**           | To incentivize market creation, the Polkamarkets Protocol gives Market Creators the possibility to set a Creator Fee as a reward for themselves. By default, it is set to be 1% of every trade, but the Market Creator can set a higher fee (up to 5%), a lower fee, or even remove the fee by setting it to 0%. The Market Creator can insert a wallet address to be the recipient of the Creator Fee. | 1% (default, but can be adjusted by the Market Creator)                                 |
