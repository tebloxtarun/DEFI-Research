### 1. **Detailed Use Case Description**
   - **Use Case Name:** View Data
   - **Actor:** Trader/User
   - **Description:** This use case describes how a Trader/User accesses and views detailed information about tokens, liquidity pools, and transaction histories on a DEX platform.
   - **Preconditions:** The Trader/User must be logged into the DEX with a connected wallet (optional for viewing general data).
   - **Postconditions:** The Trader/User is able to see updated and accurate information regarding the tokens, pools, and transactions as per their query or selection.
   - **Main Success Scenario:**
     1. The Trader/User navigates to the data viewing section on the DEX interface.
     2. The DEX displays various options to select data type: Tokens, Pools, or Transactions.
     3. The Trader/User selects the desired data type to view.
     4. The DEX retrieves data from the blockchain and other relevant sources and displays it.
     5. The Trader/User can further interact with the data, such as filtering, sorting, or drilling down into specific details.
   - **Extensions:**
     - **4a.** Data retrieval fails due to network issues:
       - **4a1.** The DEX notifies the Trader/User about the failure and suggests retrying.
     - **5a.** The Trader/User requests data that requires higher access permissions (e.g., detailed transaction logs):
       - **5a1.** The DEX requests additional authentication or denies access based on user privileges.
   - **Special Requirements:** Ensure data accuracy and real-time updates. Implement user-friendly data visualization tools.

### 2. **Requirement Specification**
   - **Functional Requirements:**
     - The system must support real-time data retrieval for tokens, pools, and transactions.
     - Provide filtering and sorting capabilities to manage large datasets effectively.
     - Ensure data integrity and confidentiality, especially for transaction history.
   - **Non-Functional Requirements:**
     - Performance: The system must handle high volumes of data without significant delays.
     - Scalability: Capable of scaling to accommodate growth in data size and user numbers.
     - Usability: Interactive and intuitive data visualization for ease of use.

### 3. **System Design**
   - **Architecture:** Use a modular architecture that allows for efficient data fetching and display from blockchain and off-chain storage.
   - **Database Design:** Use a combination of real-time database systems and caching mechanisms to enhance performance.
   - **Security Design:** Implement role-based access control for sensitive data and ensure secure data transmission.

### 4. **Prototyping**
   - Create interactive prototypes that showcase the data visualization interface, including charts, graphs, and tables.
   - Include user interface elements for data filtering and sorting.

### 5. **Development**
   - Develop the backend services to fetch and serve data reliably and securely.
   - Implement the frontend features using modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries for data visualization (e.g., D3.js, React).

### 6. **Testing**
   - **Unit Testing:** Test each component of the data retrieval and display modules.
   - **Integration Testing:** Ensure the components work together seamlessly, particularly the interface interactions and data fetch/response cycles.
   - **System Testing:** Validate the complete functionality with simulated real-world data loads.
   - **Acceptance Testing:** Conduct user testing to confirm the data is accessible, accurate, and useful as expected.

### 7. **Deployment**
   - Gradually deploy the feature, starting with beta users to gather early feedback and adjust accordingly.
   - Fully deploy once stability and performance are validated.

### 8. **Training and Documentation**
   - Provide documentation and tutorials on how to navigate and use the data viewing tools effectively.
   - Offer support materials for troubleshooting common issues.

### 9. **Maintenance and Iteration**
   - Continuously monitor the system for performance and user feedback.
   - Update and improve the data presentation based on new technologies and user demands.
