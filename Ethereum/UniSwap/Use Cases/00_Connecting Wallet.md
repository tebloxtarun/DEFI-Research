### 1. **Detailed Use Case Description**
   - **Use Case Name:** Connect Wallet
   - **Actor:** Trader/User
   - **Description:** This use case describes how a Trader/User connects their digital wallet to the DEX to enable trading activities.
   - **Preconditions:** The Trader/User must have a compatible digital wallet installed with sufficient permissions.
   - **Postconditions:** The Trader/User’s wallet is connected, and they can start trading activities.
   - **Main Success Scenario:**
     1. The Trader/User selects the "Connect Wallet" option on the DEX interface.
     2. The DEX displays a list of compatible wallets.
     3. The Trader/User selects their wallet type and is redirected to the wallet’s login interface.
     4. The Trader/User authenticates and authorizes the DEX to access their wallet.
     5. The DEX confirms the wallet connection and updates the user interface to show the wallet’s status as connected.
   - **Extensions:**
     - **3a** The wallet type selected is not supported:
       - **3a1.** The DEX notifies the Trader/User about the incompatibility.
     - **4a.** Authentication fails:
       - **4a1.** The Trader/User is prompted to try logging in again or choose another authentication method.
   - **Special Requirements:** Ensure secure communication during wallet connection to prevent interception and fraud.

### 2. **Requirement Specification**
   - **Functional Requirements:**
     - The system must support multiple wallet types (e.g., MetaMask, TrustWallet).
     - The system should securely manage authentication tokens or sessions.
     - The system should provide clear error messages for authentication failures or incompatibilities.
   - **Non-Functional Requirements:**
     - Security: Use secure and up-to-date authentication protocols.
     - Usability: Interface must be intuitive and guide the user through the wallet connection process.
     - Performance: Wallet connection should be completed within a few seconds to ensure a smooth user experience.

### 3. **System Design**
   - **Architecture:** Integrate a third-party service or use APIs that facilitate wallet connections.
   - **Database Design:** Store session information and token data securely.
   - **Security Design:** Implement OAuth for secure authentication, use HTTPS for all communications, and ensure data encryption for stored session tokens.

### 4. **Prototyping**
   - Develop a prototype of the wallet connection interface.
   - Include screens showing different stages: selecting a wallet, authentication prompts, and error handling.

### 5. **Development**
   - Develop the functionality as per design using secure coding practices.
   - Integrate with wallet APIs or services that support wallet management.

### 6. **Testing**
   - **Unit Testing:** Test individual components like API integrations and error handling.
   - **Integration Testing:** Ensure that the wallet connection process works seamlessly with the DEX’s trading functionalities.
   - **System Testing:** Test the complete process in an environment that mimics live trading conditions.
   - **Acceptance Testing:** Have real users test the wallet connection process to gather feedback and ensure it meets user expectations.

### 7. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the feature in a controlled environment initially to monitor its performance and gather early feedback.
   - Roll out the feature to all users after ensuring stability.

### 8. **Training and Documentation**
   - Provide documentation on how to connect various types of wallets.
   - Offer troubleshooting guides for common issues encountered during the wallet connection process.

### 9. **Maintenance and Iteration**
   - Monitor for any issues post-deployment and address them promptly.
   - Update the wallet connection feature based on user feedback and new wallet technologies emerging in the market.
